## Exercise I

a) O(n)

b) O(n^2)

c) O(n)

## Exercise II

In this problem you're looking for the first floor that will break eggs when you drop it. Because it's a building the floors are already sorted (Floor 10 can't come before Floor 4).

My algorithmic solution to this would be a binary search which is a runtime of O(log n).
